            	Copernicus started as an idea to bring the web environment to the town of Carlos Barbosa and its neighbour cities. Internet was new back then and our main role as a digital agency was to introduce this new concept to the companies around us.<br>
                As any small startup, my role was divided into several fields, like management, development and design. Later on focusing on design.<br>
                Even though I am not directly connected to the company, I still provide design services & consultancy when needed.
